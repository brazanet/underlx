<p><b>Which services do I need to activate on my phone/tablet so that UnderLX works correctly?</b><p>

<p>You might need to have Wi-Fi enabled, even if you don't connect to any network, so UnderLX can search for networks. In some devices, that's not needed, as they can search for networks even with the Wi-Fi disabled</p>
<p>If UnderLX is not logging your trips correctly, make sure Wi-Fi is set to stay on during stand-by</p>
<p>An Internet connection is not necessary while in the Lisbon Metro, even though that will allow you to receive disturbance notifications while down there and, in the future, will allow for other real-time features to work, like checking waiting times</p>
