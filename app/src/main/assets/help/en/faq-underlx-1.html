<p><b>What is UnderLX?</b><p>

<p>UnderLX is an Android app that shows info about the Lisbon Metro and collects anonymous data about its usage, for analysis so even more information can be presented later. The goal is to help the Lisbon Metro user in its trips, making it easier and more comfortable to use this means of transportation</p>
<p>The information made available includes news and service interruptions as officially published, statistics about those interruptions (disturbances), info about each station, network maps, etc</p>
<p>The collected data will allow for calculating different statistics, like the time between stations, the mean waiting time, the relative usage of each station, the amount of users depending on the time of the day, etc. This data will be analysed and published as soon as the amount of available data and technical resources allow</p>
