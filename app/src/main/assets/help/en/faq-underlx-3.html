<p><b>How does UnderLX work?</b><p>

<p>This app finds its location in subway stations by identifying the wireless networks available in the stations. It keeps working in the background on your device, and when it detects it is at a station, is starts a new trip log.</p>
<p>The app keeps searching for networks for some minutes, waiting for you to move to another station. When it stops identifying networks that belong to stations, it marks the trip as finished.</p>
<p>Anonymous data about each trip is sent to your servers, so we can calculate statistics about the network utilization, as well as things like the mean waiting time and spacing between trains. This data includes only the stations you have gone through and the entry and exit times for each of them.</p>
<p>The location system is not perfect and sometimes "loses" stations, so you have the opportunity to correct or confirm each trip log, for seven days after the corresponding trip. Correcting a trip log allows you to adjust the end and start points for the trip.</p>
