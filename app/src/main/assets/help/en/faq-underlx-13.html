<p><b>How can I help UnderLX?</b><p>

<p>By installing the app and recording your travels you are already helping us by providing precious information to improve our service.</p>
<p>Since we want to maintain our independence and neutrality, and avoid the use of advertising, we depend on donations to support our project. We have been working in it in a dedicated way for over a year, in our spare time, in a total of thousands of hours of work. This project has real costs associated with, for example, Internet hosting, trips for application testing, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to help us and be part of this project, while receiving exclusive rewards, you can make us a small monthly contribution <a href="https://www.patreon.com/underlx">in our Patreon</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can check <a href="https://perturbacoes.pt/donate">here</a> how to help us.</p>
<p>Your contribution will motivate us and enable us to continue to develop the entire UnderLX, ensuring the continuity and independence of the project.</p>
