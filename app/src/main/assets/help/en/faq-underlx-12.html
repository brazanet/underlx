<p><b>How can I download all the extra content (station trivia and connections)?</b><p>

<p>When you read the trivia for a station, or the connection information with other transit networks, UnderLX downloads a small piece of content for that station.</p>
<p>In case you want to use the app offline, you can download all this extra content at once:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure your device is connected to the Internet;</li>
    <li>In the navigation drawer, select the last option: "About UnderLX";</li>
    <li>Look for the button "Download extra content" and tap it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This content is downloaded to the device's cache and might be automatically deleted, if Android needs to free up space. Also note that if you change the device's language, you might need to download the extra content again.</p>
<p>The complete extra content incurs a 2 MB download.</p>
