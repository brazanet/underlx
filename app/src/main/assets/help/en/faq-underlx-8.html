<p><b>I need to take a bus, train or boat to continue my trip, how can I find information about it?</b><p>

<p>In the information screen for a station, options exist to see the connections with other mass transit networks.</p>
<p>If you're still in the subway and the app is aware of that, just touch the name of the current station on top of the home screen in the app, to open that information screen.</p>
<p>If not, open the network map from the navigation drawer, zoom in and tap the name of the closest station to open the info screen for that station.</p>
<p>Some of these buttons will exist on that screen, depending on the available connections: "Bus lines", "Ferry routes" and "Rail services". You'll need an internet connection to show this information, unless you've already seen it for that particular station, or you've <a href="help:faq-underlx-12">downloaded all extra content</a>.</p>
